# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

I write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable by creating specific classes based on object-oriented programming principles. All of my code has dedicated testing segments to verify successful implementation. These tests throw necessary errors so that debugging is made easier as well.
My Crud Module is its own dedicated class and file which makes it easy to use in other Pymongo based systems because it has no other file dependencies. The create, read, update, and delete methods within this module could be used on other compatible databases in my future work.

# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I approach a problem as a computer scientist by using stepwise processes with iterative methodology so that I keep a dedicated and consistent workflow. I also always research the problem that I have thoroughly in case there is information discovered by others have have worked on similar problems which can help me with my own. This proved trememendously helpful in this project because I was able to use similar work from other databases to better understand and develop my own queries. 

# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

I am unfamiliary with other computer scientists work as I do not yet work in the field. I have, however had some observation of the work done by my professors, which is always thoruoughly notated and organized. I hope to mirror this style of work so that my code is highly understandable and reusable. This will help the GS company as well because their work would benefit from organization and documentation.
